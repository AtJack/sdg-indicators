This is a development website for collecting and disseminating German data for the Sustainable Development Goal global indicators. Building on the earlier work of the [ONS Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/programmesandprojects/sustainabledevelopmentgoals) team, the [ONS Data Science Campus](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampushttps://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampushttps://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampushttps://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampushttps://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampus) and the [US GSA](https://github.com/GSA/sdg-indicators). Currently data on the site may be test data.

For any guidance on how to use the website or develop it further for your own country, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/sdg-indicators/wiki). Please send any comments and feedback to <a href ="mailto:"></a>
